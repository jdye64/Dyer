Idea is to just keep track of how much wood I have in inventory and decide if I need to buy more materials for
something that I want to build. So far idea includes the method of "checking out" and "checking in" to the
"WoodInventory". Reason for this is because you might have a giant sheet of plywood and only need to use a small
piece of it. So you check out the entire sheet and after building you check back in what you have left. This allows
for a simple but effective manner of keeping track of what you have in inventory. Also since certain items will be in
 the "checked out" status you can constantly be reminded what inventory you need to "check back in" so you don't
 forget to check pieces back in.
